### **Example Scenario:**

ðŸ“Œ **Reason for the Threat Hunt:**  
**Unusual System Behavior Reported**  
An employee reported that their browser (Google Chrome) is behaving strangelyâ€”opening random tabs, redirecting search results, and running slower than normal. Management suspects a malicious Chrome extension may have been installed and asks for a threat hunt across systems.

### **Steps Taken**

**1. Searched the DeviceProcessEvents Table â€“ Chrome Launched with Suspicious Arguments**  
ðŸ•’ **Timestamp:** April 5, 2025 â€“ 10:18:05 PM to 10:18:17 PM  
I began my investigation by examining process activity on the device **"vmgoogle-corey"**. I identified multiple instances of `chrome.exe` being launched by the user **"labuser"** with suspicious command-line arguments such as `--extension-process`, `--utility-sub-type=chrome.mojom.ProcessorMetrics`, and `--disable-gpu-compositing`. These flags are often linked to browser automation, side-loaded extensions, and exploit frameworks, which raised initial red flags suggesting potential browser manipulation or script execution.

**2. Searched the DeviceFileEvents Table â€“ Tampermonkey .CRX File Downloaded**  
ðŸ•’ **Timestamp:** April 5, 2025 â€“ 10:30:29 PM  
Next, I pivoted to file download activity and discovered that the user **"labuser"** downloaded a `.crx` file named **`dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo_10721.crx`**. The file was written to Chromeâ€™s Webstore Downloads folder, confirming it was retrieved via the browser process (`chrome.exe`). The filename matches the Tampermonkey extension, and its download outside of Chromeâ€™s official extension store suggests a **side-loaded extension**, which is commonly used for injecting malicious userscripts or browser-based data theft tools.

**3. Searched the DeviceNetworkEvents Table â€“ External Connections Initiated by Chrome**  
ðŸ•’ **Timestamp:** April 5, 2025 â€“ 10:35:02 PM to 10:35:11 PM  
Shortly after the `.crx` download, I found that `chrome.exe`, still under the **"labuser"** account, established multiple outbound HTTPS connections to several external domains. These included:

- **tampermonkey.net** (extension beaconing)  
- **x.bidswitch.net** (suspicious adtech domain often abused for C2)  
- **temu.com**, **reddit.com**, and **youtube-nocookie.com** (likely used to blend in with normal web traffic)

This behavior strongly indicated that the **side-loaded Tampermonkey extension had triggered automated scripts**, potentially used to **exfiltrate browser data**, **gather system info**, or **connect to attacker infrastructure**, while hiding among trusted traffic.

**4. Searched the DeviceFileEvents Table â€“ Suspicious Export File Created and Modified**  
ðŸ•’ **Timestamp:** April 5, 2025 â€“ 10:37:22 PM to 10:38:16 PM  
I then observed the creation and modification of a file named **`browser-data-export.txt.txt`**, along with a `.lnk` shortcut version in the **Recent Files** folder. This file was created, modified twice, and renamed within one minuteâ€”indicating possible **manual data staging** or **preparation for browser data exfiltration**. The folder path showed it was located on the userâ€™s Desktop, and the shortcut suggests the file had been interacted with, either by a user or script.

**5. Searched the DeviceFileEvents Table â€“ Malicious Script Reference Found**  
ðŸ•’ **Timestamp:** April 6, 2025 â€“ 12:27:49 AM  
Finally, I discovered a newly created shortcut file titled **`harmful scripts tampermonkey.lnk`** located in the userâ€™s **Recent Items** directory. This strongly suggests that a **Tampermonkey userscriptâ€”potentially harmfulâ€”was launched or interacted with** shortly after the previous suspicious activity. The naming convention, along with its placement, points to either an **attacker leaving artifacts** behind or a **simulation of script-based post-exploitation activity**.

### **Summary**

On **April 5, 2025**, I investigated suspicious activity on **device "vmgoogle-corey"** tied to the user **"labuser"**. The user launched **Chrome with suspicious command-line arguments**, then downloaded a **Tampermonkey `.crx` extension** outside the official Chrome Web Storeâ€”indicating a likely **side-loaded, unauthorized extension**.

Minutes later, Chrome initiated **outbound connections** to domains including **tampermonkey.net**, **x.bidswitch.net**, and others commonly used to **blend malicious traffic into normal web activity**. This suggests the extension triggered **automated scripts**, potentially used for **data exfiltration or system reconnaissance**.

Shortly after, a file named **`browser-data-export.txt.txt`** was created and modified, followed by the appearance of a shortcut labeled **`harmful scripts tampermonkey.lnk`**, pointing to a **malicious userscript** in useâ€”likely part of a **script-based post-exploitation technique**.

---

### **Response Taken**

**Tampermonkey-based malicious activity was confirmed on endpoint `vmgoogle-corey` by user `labuser`. The device was isolated and the user's direct manager was notified.**
